To the TA:
  1. The text file portion of the deliverables are in the folder titles "Document Deliverables"
  2. To run the app, I placed full instructions in the document "TastyTracker User Manual", however, I will explain here as well.

To Run the App:
  1.	First download and install Android Studios (https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA9bq6BhAKEiwAH6bqoGjaus-Hg9DXVxtQQ3rvVU-uvnTWExv53GosUXi6c8KAE5TE_aKtpBoCJ2gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
  2.	Create a Virtual device (Android Guide- https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)
  3.	From the Android Welcome Screen, select More Actions > Virtual Device Manager
  4.	Create a project, then select View > Tool Windows > Device Manager from the main menu bar,   then click the +, and then click Create Virtual Device.
  5.	I recommend selecting the Pixel 9 Pro XL as the device
  6.	The application requires an API greater than 24, I recommend 34 (“UpsideDownCake”).
  7.	From the device manager screen, press the triangle to start the emulator
  8. Go to the TastyTracker Releases on GitHub and open up the Assets drop down (https://github.com/JulieWhite2150/TastyTracker/releases)
  9. Download the .apk file named app-debug.apk
  10. Find the .apk file in your file explorer and drag and drop the file onto the running emulator.
  11. After the app downloads, you can click the app on the home screen to start the app.
